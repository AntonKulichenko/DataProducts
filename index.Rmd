## Description

This Shiny App is written to provide  energy consumption information, namely:

- gas
- electricity
- water

for the years 2012 to 2014.

---
## Details

The source Excel sheet contains the figures for each of the three meters on a weekly basis.

---
## Example

Here are the first 10 lines of the Excel file:

```{r head-10-lines, echo=FALSE}
data <- read.csv("consumption.csv", sep=",", header=T)
subset(data, select=c(Date,PriceGas,PriceElec,PriceWater))[1:10, ]
```

## Lessons learned

- Necessary to use reactive function as soon as I have 2 inputs or more.

- In the renderPlot function the name of the dataframe must be followed by parentheses.

---
## Conclusion

- Shiny gives R a decent interactivity sufficient for everyday apps.

- Slidify rocks for creating quick nicely-looking presentations.
